# Simulation of KUKA robot in matlab simulink and App designer
This project contains a general tab designed by APPDESIGNER. By inserting the parameters of DH table with determining the situation of each link if it is prizmatic or revolute, we find the transformation matrix, Jacobian matrix, joints angles and a 3d plot for visualization of the robot according to inserted DH table. 
The other tab is for KUKA kr8 r1420 arc hw robot in addition to calculating inverse kinematics with Forward and Back Reaching Inverse Kinematics and Cyclic Coordinate Descent methods. 
Using cad files of the robot to create simscape file. 
Creating simulation environment for 6DOF robotic arm using Peter Corke Robotics Toolbox.
